#Bitbuck backup

## Description
This python script will backup all of your bitbucket repos (both mercurial and git) locally.
If the repository does not exist locally the repo will be cloned to the <local_backup_location>.
If the repo does exist locally an `hg pull` will be run for mercurial repos,
an `git remote update` will be run for git repos.

## Quickstart
`python backup.py -u <bitbucket_username> -p <bitbucket_password> [-t <bitbucket_team>] -l <local_backup_location>`

The password is needed to access the bitbucket api's.  At this time it is not used to do the clone/update.
Clone/update requires that your ssh keys have been uploaded to bitbucket.

You can backup a team's repositories instead of your own by supplying the optional `-t` parameter.

## Requirements
* Python (there are no external dependencies that are not included)

You do need to have your ssh keys uploaded for the computer that you are running the backup on.
This could be changed in the future but it would require storing your password in the backed up repos which is no good (in my opinion).

##Additional notes
I am hosting this on GitHub because I believe it is superior for public repos (I understand the irony).
